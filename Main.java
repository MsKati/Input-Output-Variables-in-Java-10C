/*Java Variables types
You have 5 types of variablesin Java
Boolean: True/False,only 2 state - boolean
Integers: Int , always WHOLE numbers
Strings: Text, ex "Hello", ALWAYS between quotation
Floats: Decimals, ex 19.99 or -19.99
Char: single characters, "A", "B", Write a code hat give you how many characters are in "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"


In math, x = 4 means 4 = x
In programming x = 4 (4 is assigned to x)

x = "patty"
b = "tomato"
c = "Cheese"
d = "bread"
e = "Lettuce"
f = "Ketchup"
g = "mayo"

So the tamplate is: type variable = value;
